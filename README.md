**here's a short story by ChatGPT on the sham state between Silicon Valley and D.C.**

## The Input 

Write a short story, "What Happens When You Apply For A High-Paying Tech Job On The American West Coast." 
Here are the main points:  
- the application process is easy.  
- you won't get the job.  
- tech executives will bombard your news feed with bull crap, and get your siblings to participate in MKUltra.  
- the local police want to get in on the action.  
- you won't get a 6-figure salary when another angry man from England or Germany robs a silicon valley bank.  
- the internet was and is built by girls, apparently.  

## The Story 
**What Happens When You Apply For A High-Paying Tech Job On The American West Coast**

The application process was painless—five clicks, a résumé upload, and a cheery email telling you, *“We’ll be in touch soon!”* It almost felt like the dream was within reach, that elusive six-figure salary glimmering on the horizon like San Francisco Bay in the morning sun.

Except you don’t get the job. You never do. Instead, your inbox fills with newsletters about innovation summits, mental health apps, and AI that promises to change the world but mostly just changes who gets to bill who.

Soon your news feed mutates. CEOs beam like cult leaders from staged interviews, telling you to “believe in yourself” while their companies quietly strip-mine every digital trace of your life. Somehow, your siblings are suddenly signed up for experimental “wellness studies” that sound more MKUltra than meditation retreat. You ask questions; they tell you it’s all in your head.

Then the local police start sniffing around. They’re not after criminals. They just want to play. Surveillance toys from the Valley trickle down to precincts, and the cops grin like kids with new Nerf guns. Only these Nerf guns can ruin lives.

Meanwhile, the global economy wobbles. A man from England, maybe Germany—it doesn’t matter anymore—storms into a Silicon Valley bank and leaves with bags of cash, fury, and headlines. You think: *Well, that kills my six-figure salary for another decade.*

And yet, the strangest part is the whisper campaign. Every feed, every podcast, every keynote claims the same thing: the internet was, and still is, built by girls. They say it like a spell, as if repetition alone can rewrite history. You wonder if it’s true, or if it’s just another revisionist fairy tale designed to keep you doubting yourself.

In the end, applying for the job feels less like a career step and more like being drafted into a war you never signed up for—a war fought with data, distraction, and carefully staged dreams.
