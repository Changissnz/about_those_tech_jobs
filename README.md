**here's a short story by ChatGPT on the sham state between Silicon Valley and D.C.**

## The Input 

Write a short story, "What Happens When You Apply For A High-Paying Tech Job On The American West Coast." 
Here are the main points:  
- the application process is easy.  
- you won't get the job.  
- tech executives will bombard your news feed with bull crap, and get your siblings to participate in MKUltra.  
- the local police want to get in on the action.  
- you won't get a 6-figure salary when another angry man from England or Germany robs a silicon valley bank.  
- the internet was and is built by girls, apparently.  

## The Story 
**What Happens When You Apply For A High-Paying Tech Job On The American West Coast**

The application process was painless—five clicks, a résumé upload, and a cheery email telling you, *“We’ll be in touch soon!”* It almost felt like the dream was within reach, that elusive six-figure salary glimmering on the horizon like San Francisco Bay in the morning sun.

Except you don’t get the job. You never do. Instead, your inbox fills with newsletters about innovation summits, mental health apps, and AI that promises to change the world but mostly just changes who gets to bill who.

Soon your news feed mutates. CEOs beam like cult leaders from staged interviews, telling you to “believe in yourself” while their companies quietly strip-mine every digital trace of your life. Somehow, your siblings are suddenly signed up for experimental “wellness studies” that sound more MKUltra than meditation retreat. You ask questions; they tell you it’s all in your head.

Then the local police start sniffing around. They’re not after criminals. They just want to play. Surveillance toys from the Valley trickle down to precincts, and the cops grin like kids with new Nerf guns. Only these Nerf guns can ruin lives.

Meanwhile, the global economy wobbles. A man from England, maybe Germany—it doesn’t matter anymore—storms into a Silicon Valley bank and leaves with bags of cash, fury, and headlines. You think: *Well, that kills my six-figure salary for another decade.*

And yet, the strangest part is the whisper campaign. Every feed, every podcast, every keynote claims the same thing: the internet was, and still is, built by girls. They say it like a spell, as if repetition alone can rewrite history. You wonder if it’s true, or if it’s just another revisionist fairy tale designed to keep you doubting yourself.

In the end, applying for the job feels less like a career step and more like being drafted into a war you never signed up for—a war fought with data, distraction, and carefully staged dreams.

## The Input 
write another short story, "The American Thought That He Could Deceive U.S. (Undershatenen Staschischung)".

## The Story 
**The American Thought That He Could Deceive U.S. (Undershatenen Staschischung)**

He thought it would be easy. Just slip through the system, fake a few documents, maybe game an algorithm or two. After all, America had always rewarded boldness—the hustler spirit, the man who could smile while lying through his teeth.

But this wasn’t the old game anymore. Somewhere in the sprawl of alphabet agencies and defense contractors, a phrase circulated like a curse: Undershatenen Staschischung. It had no clear translation, though rumors said it was a hybrid of German bureaucratic slang and Slavic counterintelligence jargon. Roughly, it meant “the one who pretends to outwit the system becomes the system’s prey.”

The American didn’t know that. He only knew that when he clicked Submit Application for that lucrative contract, the lights in his apartment dimmed for half a second. His phone chirped. His sister called him the next morning with a strange lilt in her voice, saying she had enrolled in a government “resilience program.”

Soon his news feeds were nothing but messages from smiling executives, telling him that everything was fine—while spliced audio clips of his own voice appeared in commercials he had never recorded. He tried the police, but the local officers only shrugged, as if they had already been briefed on his case.

And then came the banks. Not the ones you could walk into, but the digital ones, the shadow institutions that kept Silicon Valley afloat. A theft in Frankfurt. A breach in London. “An angry man again,” the headlines read, but behind them was the same implication: your salary is gone before it exists.

By then he understood: he hadn’t been applying for a job. He had been volunteering as a test subject in Undershatenen Staschischung. The real program wasn’t about hiring anyone—it was about teaching Americans what happens when they think they can deceive the U.S.

The system smiled back at him through his own reflection. And he realized, too late, that it was never about truth or lies. It was about whether you kept chewing the mint.
